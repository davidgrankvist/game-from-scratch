# game-from-scratch
A game from scratch.

## About

The purpose of this project is to understand game programming on a deeper level by implementing a game from scratch.

This project is inspired by Casey Muratori's excellent [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) video series. While I have learned concepts from the videos, the game design and code in this project are independent.

### What is the game about?

I don't know yet.
